## Business Description
Atliqo is a new bank which wants to launch a credit card.  In the growing market of India, they are facing tough competition among their competitors. So, we need to design the credit cards carefully so we this project will not fail.
While designing the credit cards we need to consider of few factors
•	Which age group we need to target so the credit cards will be accessed the most?
•	User of which job type will access the credit card?
•	What is the income type and payment type to include any offers to stand out from the competitors?

We divide the project into two phases

### Phase 2: Trail Run on a small group 
Statistics concept used:
•	Central limit theorem
•	Hypothesis testing
•	Confidence intervals

### Insights from phase 1:

Insights specific to customers with age group of 18 - 25
•	People with age group of 18 -25 accounts to approx. 25% of customer base in the data
•	Avg annual income of this age group is less than 50k

### Insights from phase 2:
We have two groups in the phase 2 target group [the analysis group from phase 1] and control group [after the campaign conducted according to phase 1 results]. After conducting the hypothesis testing for both the groups the results in the phase 2 shows the null hypothesis is rejected according to z-score.
